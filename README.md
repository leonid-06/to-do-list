# to-do-list

Hello! This project is receiving its first working version and is not currently being developed.
But in the future, perhaps I will continue.
There are two ways to run the latest working version.
1) By doing a git pull and replacing the name `application.properties.example` with `application.properties`
2) Go to [My Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/leonid06/todolist/general) and pull these image

You can see the result [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XjDD_eBVRVwwlSis6zeonTAs1HExDEEp?usp=sharing)
